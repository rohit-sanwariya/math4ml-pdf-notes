# 📘 Math for Machine Learning – 30 Day PDF Notes  

This repository contains my **30-Day Math for AI/ML Notes Series**, where each day I cover a key mathematical concept that forms the backbone of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  

The notes are written in **LaTeX** and exported as **PDFs**, making them clean, structured, and easy to revise.
